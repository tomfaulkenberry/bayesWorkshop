# Workshop on Bayesian Inference

This repository contains materials for my workshop on Bayesian inference held at SWPA 2018. 

## Materials
- Workshop slides (coming soon!)
- [JASP software](http://jasp-stats.org)

## Data sets 
Each of these datasets is formatted in CSV (comma separated value) format, which is the format required for JASP. You will want to download the files somewhere on your computer. Windows users should "right-click" on the CSV link. Mac users should "ctrl+click" on the CSV link.

  - mental arithmetic ([csv](datasets/mental_arithmetic.csv))
  - eye movements ([csv](datasets/eye_movements.csv))
  - kitchen rolls ([csv](datasets/kitchen_rolls.csv))
